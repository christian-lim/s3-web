                                THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy. To this date, THON has raised $180 million in our fight against pediatric cancer.

                        <p>Tech stack: Django (Python 3.5), HTML, CSS. CI/CD via Travis CI.</p>
                        <p>
                                I have had the privilege of volunteering as a technology captain for two years in college.
                                My first year was spent coding for the THON Weekend Dashboard as a Dash developer, and my second year was spent as the Special Projects Lead Developer, where my team created the Quizzes platform.
                                Developing our applications in Django, I had the unique experience of having 50,000 users use features I and my team developed, all the while supporting an amazing cause.

                        <ul class="done-list">
                                <li>During my time volunteering (2015-2019), we raised $43,939,563!</li> 
                                <li>We had 23 members in the committee, supporting 3 applications that service 50,000 users.</li>
                                <li>Our sponsors include Dell, who provisioned laptops and servers for us, and now Amazon AWS! (Sadly, the year after I left.)</li>
                                <li>Our fundraising efforts culminates to a 46-hour dance marathon. Captains have two 4-hour sleep shifts, which meant that we sometimes had to push hot fixes while being awake for 30+ hours.</li>
