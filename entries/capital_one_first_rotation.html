                        <p>Team: Scantool - securing Capital One's entire data lake</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                                My team was tasked with maintaining security within our entire data lake comprising of 20+ petabytes of data. 
                                This was achieved through scanning files as they landed in the lake, and re-scanning the entire data lake
                                in set times during the year to maintain governance with constantly evolving policies and standards. 
                        </p>
                        <p> At our max, we can scan 1 PB per day. On a more normal basis, we scan roughly 300-400 terabytes a day.</p>
                        <p>AWS services I got familiar with:  EC2, S3, RDS, SQS, Lambda, IAM, Cloudformation, CloudWatch.</p>
                        <p>AWS services I used briefly: DynamoDb, SNS.</p>
                        <p>Other tools I used: Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, ELK, Docker, Snowflake.</p>

                <ul class="done-list">
                        <li>Implemented caching solution for operations reaching 5000 TPS, reducing millions of false positive in our scanning.</li>
                        <li>Implemented caching solution to alleviate RDS replicas during intensive workloads evaluating 40 million objects frequently.</li>
                        <li>Managed a team of 5 analysts focused on examining our scan results for true and false positives. Reported results to leadership to evaluate value.</li>
                        <li>Worked with adding custom features supporting our federated infrastructure, managed by toggling profiles. This allowed internal partners to run our tool suite for their own particular needs.</li>
                        <li>Quantified impacts of features developed through metrics integrated with Datadog.</li>
                        <li>Delievered 'data managers' that directly scanned hundreds of terabytes of data per day.</li>
                        <li>Created various REST APIs to fulfill our applications' needs.</li>
                        <li>Created components in our SPA React.js frontend.</li>
                        <li>Integrated with Snowflake to enable easy querying of our data.</li>
                        <li>Used Lambda + CloudWatch to assist with activating a custom graceful shutdown in our autoscaling policies.</li>
                        <li>Actively contribute to our team's support channels.</li>
                        <li>Volunteered to host lunch meetings for tech interviewees.    :)</li>
