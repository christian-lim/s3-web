        <p> This site utilizes AWS S3's static webhosting capabilities. The setup was super simple, with most of my time spent figuring out the layout of the site itself. 
        </p>
        <p>This site was deployed as of ADD_DATE_HERE, but it was actually first created in December 2018. I was originally hoping to create some interactive forum which can support multiple users, store entries, comments, images, etc. all backed by various AWS services like RDS, S3, and DynamoDB. Just to start, I spun up an instance with Elastic Beanstalk. I set the cheapest settings, and let it run for a month. At the end, it cost me ~$15. That might seem small, but that was a rice, beans, and eggs for a week!
